        I am an accomplished professional with a B.Tech Degree from IIT Roorkee.
        Notably, he played a pivotal role as part of IPAC, leading the WB-AITC
        campaign in Kolkata and the North Parganas Zone from 2019 to 2021. His
        exceptional performance in the WB elections for IPAC/AITC propelled him
        to join Namo briefly, where he devised a comprehensive strategy to
        target the 120 critical L.S. Assemblies that BJP failed to secure in the
        2019 GE. In 2021, Raghav co-founded Ace Analytics alongside his esteemed
        colleagues from IIT and IPAC. The organization made significant
        contributions to political campaigns, notably supporting a senior
        cabinet minister from BJP in the UP Assembly Elections and collaborating
        with the INC State President for the Goa Assembly elections. Their
        expertise was sought after in 2022, as they advised the INC Rajasthan
        State President on crucial political matters, including candidate
        selection, organization building, and padyatras throughout Rajasthan.
        Additionally, Ace Analytics collaborated with TRS in the same year,
        providing in-depth assembly reports and statewide surveys, encompassing
        119 constituencies. Currently, Ace Analytics is actively engaged with
        esteemed senior MPs from various states such as Orissa, U.P., and
        Telangana. They offer their expertise in social media campaigns and
        public outreach programs, effectively supporting these politicians in
        their endeavors to connect with the masses and amplify their presence.
